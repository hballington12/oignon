# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 17 Dec 2025

## Overview

Oignon is a citation graph visualization tool. We are committed to transparency about data practices. In short: we collect minimal data, store nothing on our servers, and do not track you.

## Data Stored on Your Device

The app stores the following data locally on your device to improve your experience:

- **Preferences** (e.g., color scheme)
- **Followed authors**
- **Bookmarked papers**
- **Cached graph data** (node-edge relationships for previously viewed citation graphs)

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers. You can clear this data at any time by clearing the app's storage or uninstalling the app.

## Data We Do Not Collect

- We do not require account creation or login
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not store any user data on our servers
- We do not track your location
- We do not access contacts, camera, or other device features

## Third-Party Services

The app retrieves citation and publication metadata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), an open catalog of scholarly works. Requests to OpenAlex are made directly from your device. Please refer to [OpenAlex's terms of service](https://openalex.org/terms) for information about their data practices.

## Analytics

We use PostHog to collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., feature usage, API call counts). This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individual users. No personal information is collected.

## Changes to This Policy

If our data practices change, we will update this policy and revise the "Last updated" date above.
